Azul el Martes 7 de marzo 2023 a la firma Casabo  el motivo de la visita fue escuchar en persona y ver insitu el reclamo que ellos recibieron de su cliente por los estuches que le fabricaron de Maní con Chocolate marca Hass. El cliente les reclama que tuvieron que levantar del mercado 700.000 estuches por estar la gran mayoría despegados en la costura lateral. Esto ocurrió en plena temporada en la campaña navideña con los agravantes que esto trajo  desprestigio pérdidas de ventas que no se realizaron. Lo que se observa es que el adhesivo al tiempo estando el producto en góndola se abre al medio produciendo lo que se conoce como falla adhesiva ya que queda producto de ambos lados con el tack suficiente como para volver a juntarse pero a las horas se despega nuevamente. En un principio Casabo reclama unos 14.500 USD que es el costo que ellos tuvieron que invertir para producir nuevamente estuches con otro adhesivo provisto por Henkel y luego continuaron con el que Cia. Azul entrego procedente de Brasil tras un embarque vía aérea que fue recomendado por Nosotros y que funciona sin ningún inconveniente ( CQ 4163/1 ). Pero están a la espera de que si su cliente no los demanda por daños y perjuicios.

In addition  during the client's evaluation  it was noted that the STICKS are not exactly \"CYLINDRICAL\"  as they present deformations leaving them \"OVOID\".
